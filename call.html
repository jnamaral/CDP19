        <h1>Call for Contributions</h1>

	
	<p> The workshop on Compiler-Driven Performance has a
	particular focus on (but not limited to): Innovative compiler
	analysis, transformation, and optimization techniques
	Languages, compilers, and optimization techniques for
	multicore processors and other parallel architectures
	Compiling for streaming or heterogeneous hardware Dynamic
	compilation for high-performance and real-time environments
	Compilation, optimization, and analysis for dynamic languages
	Compilation techniques for reducing power Program safety Whole
	system optimization and analysis Tools and infrastructure for
	compiler research </p>

	<p>CDP invites contributions in the form of talk abstracts
	from researchers and practitioners. Each submission should
	include talk title, the author list with affiliations, and a
	brief abstract. Please also identify the presenter and include
	a 1-2 sentence biography. All submissions should be made
	through EasyChair no later than <DATE>.  </p>

	<p>CDP does not publish proceedings. Presenters are required
	to provide an electronic copy of their slides. The slides will
	be available on this website soon after the workshop. Work
	that has been recently published or submitted for publication
	is welcome.</p>

	<p>The International Conference on Compiler Construction (CC)
	is interested in work on processing programs in the most
	general sense: analyzing, transforming or executing input that
	describes how a system operates, including traditional
	compiler construction as a special case.  </p>
